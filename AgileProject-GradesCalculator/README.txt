Develop a simple tool called G​radesCalculator.​Given a database with various data about the students in a class, G​radesCalculator allows the instructors to get information about the students and compute their final grade. You will develop the G​radesCalculator application by following a test-driven development approach such as the one we saw in P4L4, in which development happens in iterations and according to the following cycle: (1) select story cards to implement, (2) define task cards for the selected story cards, (3) write test cases for the classes in the task cards, (4) write code that makes the test cases pass.
